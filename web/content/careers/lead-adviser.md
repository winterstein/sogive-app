SoGive conducts research on high impact philanthropy. We also support a small number of major donors.

Our model involves: supporting those donors to have as much impact as possible. Making public the things we learn in the process.

Examples of the research we have conducted include:

- Our [review of Cool Earth](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/RnmZ62kuuC8XzeTBq/why-we-have-over-rated-cool-earth) changed the Effective Altruism community’s perception of high impact climate philanthropy
- Our [critique of Founders Pledge’s analysis](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EAii5kf65cvywb2cF/why-we-think-the-founders-pledge-report-overrates-cfrn) of the Coalition for Rainforest Nations (CfRN) has caused some donors to contact us, and was followed by (but didn’t necessarily cause) FP de-recommending CfRN
- We conducted [this expert survey](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/oxdmyQWsnNwCGSLLC/we-re-surprisingly-more-positive-about-tackling-bio-risks) about the extent to which COVID makes GCBRs a more/less impactful cause area.
- We demonstrated our ability to react quickly to events with [this post](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/wpaZRoLFJy8DynwQN/the-best-places-to-donate-for-covid-19) on COVID-19-inspired donations, published in March 2020.
- We wrote a post outlining an underappreciated reason why GiveWell’s models might be overstating the value of [deworming](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/kwBoqZcHwo7Dhut94/economic-losers-sogive-s-review-of-deworming-and-why-we-re-1)
- We are currently writing an independent [evaluation of StrongMinds](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/GXBvATw7Why7xRDeM/why-sogive-is-publishing-an-independent-evaluation-of)

The amount of philanthropy we support each year is in the low single digit millions.

### <a name="_pno4tefdam8w"></a>Overview of the role, and key responsibilities

The role has three components:

- Supporting the small pool of donors with whom we currently have a relationship.
- Growing that pool of donors
- Publishing our research

The work to ***support our major donors*** involves setting strategy (i.e. targets for the proportion of the annual donations attributed to each cause area), considering moral weights, arranging meetings with organisations, and supporting the final decisions.

Our approach to ***growing our pool of donors*** largely relies on the network of SoGive’s founder and the networks of the existing donors.

In the past we have developed a research agenda, where the agenda is driven by multiple considerations and perspectives. In the future we expect the research topics to be driven by one clear focus, namely the research questions which we need to answer in the course of our work to support the donors we work with, including questions about specific organisations and interventions. **Publishing our research** will involve writing the research to a high standard, and also thinking about the best ways to put it into SoGive’s website or other venues.

There is scope for the role to develop so that it would involve overseeing the operations of SoGive, but that is not currently core to the role.

### <a name="_zf7ck7itk523"></a>About you

You likely already have a strong understanding of Effective Altruism (EA) thinking on how to give effectively.

The ideal candidate will be an excellent researcher of effective philanthropy. This will include:

- Detailed understanding of GiveWell’s models and analysis
- Familiarity with ACE’s analysis
- Strong understanding of longtermist thinking
- Excellent writing, displaying [reasoning transparency](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/reasoning-transparency/)

The ideal candidate will also be strong at managing relationships with clients.

- Excellent skills at managing relationships with clients
- Experience of conducting meetings with key stakeholders (such as the charities we assess or the donors we work with), and ability to act credibly in those contexts

The ideal candidate will also be excited about growing a philanthropy advice organisation. 

- Strong, proven ability to grow a business, including making plans, arranging funding, growing a client base and delivering value for clients.

Some candidates might think that they should only apply if they are strong on all of these areas. This would be incorrect. Applicants with strengths in some areas and a willingness to learn and grow in others are encouraged to apply.

### <a name="_5xc80r233txk"></a>Further details

- You will be SoGive’s sole employee, and you will be supported by SoGive’s founder. SoGive has historically run a volunteer programme, and some of those volunteers still have a relationship with SoGive, so some research tasks can be delegated to those volunteers.
- The role will involve meetings in London, so you should be willing to either live in London or to have frequent travel to London.
- SoGive doesn’t have an office, so you should expect to work from home or from one of the co-working spaces in London.
- We are currently unable to sponsor visas. For a candidate who is an exceptional fit, we may consider undergoing the visa application process. By “exceptional fit”, we mean that the candidate would excel at all the research, client management, and organisational management/growth components of the job.
