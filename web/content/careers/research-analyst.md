SoGive conducts research on high impact philanthropy. We also support a small number of major donors.

Our model involves: supporting those donors to have as much impact as possible. Making public the things we learn in the process.

Examples of the research we have conducted include:

- Our [review of Cool Earth](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/RnmZ62kuuC8XzeTBq/why-we-have-over-rated-cool-earth) changed the Effective Altruism community’s perception of high impact climate philanthropy
- Our [critique of Founders Pledge’s analysis](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EAii5kf65cvywb2cF/why-we-think-the-founders-pledge-report-overrates-cfrn) of the Coalition for Rainforest Nations (CfRN) has caused some donors to contact us, and was followed by (but didn’t necessarily cause) FP de-recommending CfRN
- We conducted [this expert survey](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/oxdmyQWsnNwCGSLLC/we-re-surprisingly-more-positive-about-tackling-bio-risks) about the extent to which COVID makes GCBRs a more/less impactful cause area.
- We demonstrated our ability to react quickly to events with [this post](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/wpaZRoLFJy8DynwQN/the-best-places-to-donate-for-covid-19) on COVID-19-inspired donations, published in March 2020.
- We wrote a post outlining an underappreciated reason why GiveWell’s models might be overstating the value of [deworming](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/kwBoqZcHwo7Dhut94/economic-losers-sogive-s-review-of-deworming-and-why-we-re-1)
- We are currently writing an independent [evaluation of StrongMinds](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/GXBvATw7Why7xRDeM/why-sogive-is-publishing-an-independent-evaluation-of)

The amount of philanthropy we support each year is in the low single digit millions.

### <a name="_pno4tefdam8w"></a>Overview of the role, and key responsibilities

SoGive will commission the Research Analyst to answer two questions over the course of 7 weeks of full-time work:
1. What is a reasonable cost-effectiveness threshold for donating to a longtermist organisation? (i.e., If a longtermist organisation was less cost-effective than this threshold, it would be reasonable to not donate to them in favour of searching for a more cost-effective opportunity.)
2. How cost-effective is the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk (CSER), relative to this threshold?

The Research Analyst will have to consider other novel questions in the course of this work, such as:

* What is a unit of output that is both measurable and accurate as a proxy for reducing existential risk?
* For the “unit of output” to be measurable in the time allotted, how much accuracy is sacrificed?
* Should a “unit of output” be a combination of many outputs? How should they be combined, so that a ranking can be attained?

To complete the work, the Research Analyst will take the following steps:

* Developing a plan for research
* Collecting publicly available information on evaluating the cost-effectiveness of a longtermist project
* Collecting publicly available information on CSER’s activities, outputs, and outcomes
* Determining who to interview, booking interviews, determining informational interview questions
* Developing a threshold for cost-effectiveness using a rigorous cost-effectiveness analysis method comparable to [Charity Entrepreneurship’s Cost-Effectiveness Analysis](https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/cea)
* Determining which project at CSER is best to analyse, according to its representativeness of the organisation, the availability of information about the program, and other considerations
* Interviewing staff related to a project at CSER
* Interviewing external stakeholders involved in policy
* Analysing reports and outputs produced by CSER
* Determining the extent to which we can expect the analysis of the chosen project to generalise to the cost-effectiveness of CSER as an organisation
* Writing a 2-5 page report on the threshold for cost-effectiveness
* Writing an 8-10 page report on the cost-effectiveness of CSER relative to the threshold
* Incorporating peer-review feedback


### <a name="_zf7ck7itk523"></a>About you

You have a strong understanding of effective altruism and/or cost-effective giving. You might already be familiar with tools like Charity Entrepreneurship’s Cost-Effectiveness Analysis method.

You have a strong understanding of longtermism and/or existential risk.

You enjoy working with ambitious research goals. You’re a creative thinker. You may have developed a new research framework before.

You likely have worked closely with organisations like the following at some point:

* Existential risk reduction organisations
* Policy organisations
* Research organisations

And you are familiar with the activities of such an organisation. Your background knowledge allows you to consider how the cost-effectiveness of such an organisation would be assessed.
If you have some of these experiences, but not all, we still strongly encourage you to apply.
